## Installation

First you'll need to install NodeJS from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/download/) or [node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Supported version is node 10.32.

Once installed, check the version

    node --version  #should read 0.10.32 or greater

Next install grunt-cli globally so that we can run grunt scripts later.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

    grunt --version  #verifies correct install

### Launching node

Clone this repo if you don’t have it.

    git clone <repo>

Navigate to that directory.

    cd gistbot

Install the node dependencies

    npm install #should run for sass than one minute

Check for errors. If none, we’re good. Run the command below and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    node app.js #then, open your browser at

Or if you want to develop with live-reload and JS Linting enabled:

    grunt up

Run `grunt` to live reload scss
